# What 
LOLRMM (Living Off the Land Remote Monitoring and Management) is a community-driven project that provides a curated list of Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools that could potentially be abused by threat actors. This project aims to assist security professionals in staying informed about these tools and their potential for misuse.

The project was inspired by the need to track and understand the potential security implications of legitimate RMM tools when used maliciously. By cataloging these tools and their capabilities, we hope to raise awareness and improve detection and prevention strategies in the security community.

LOLRMM is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from the security community. By sharing knowledge and expertise, we can help each other stay informed and better defend against emerging threats. Whether you're a researcher, incident responder, or system administrator, we hope that LOLRMM will be a valuable resource in your fight against cyberattacks.
